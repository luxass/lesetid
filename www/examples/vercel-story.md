In the bustling tech hub of San Francisco, amidst a sea of innovation and disruption, two individuals with a shared vision embarked on a journey that would forever alter the landscape of web development.

Guillermo Rauch, a seasoned developer renowned for his contributions to the open-source community, and Nicolás Garro, a gifted designer with a keen eye for aesthetics, recognized a critical gap in the existing deployment solutions. The available options were either overly complex or severely limited, hindering developers' ability to bring their ideas to life.

Driven by a desire to empower developers and unleash their creativity, Guillermo and Nicolás set out to create a platform that would revolutionize the way web applications were deployed. Their vision was simple yet ambitious: to create a platform that was both powerful and accessible, enabling developers to focus on building great products rather than wrestling with deployment headaches.

Late nights and countless cups of coffee fueled their relentless pursuit of excellence. As they poured their hearts and souls into their creation, their unwavering determination propelled them forward.

In 2015, their vision materialized in the form of ZEIT, a platform that made it incredibly easy to deploy and manage web applications. ZEIT quickly gained traction among developers, its popularity soaring as it became a go-to solution for deploying modern web applications.

As ZEIT's success grew, so too did the ambitions of its founders. In 2020, ZEIT underwent a rebranding, emerging as Vercel. The new name reflected the company's commitment to providing a seamless and frictionless experience for developers.

Today, Vercel stands as a testament to the power of innovation and the unwavering dedication of its founders. It is a platform that has empowered millions of developers to build and deploy their creations, shaping the future of the web.

Vercel's success is a testament to the importance of identifying and addressing unmet needs in the market. By providing a solution that is both powerful and accessible, Vercel has made it easier than ever for developers to bring their ideas to life. As the web continues to evolve, Vercel is poised to remain at the forefront of innovation, empowering developers to build the future of the web.
